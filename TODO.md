# PHPStan Errors Fixed (Max Level)

All PHPStan errors have been resolved by adding proper type annotations, PHPDoc comments, and type assertions throughout the codebase.

## Summary of Fixes:
- Added missing type specifications for array parameters and return types
- Fixed mixed type issues with proper type assertions
- Corrected class references (e.g., CsrfGuardInterface)
- Removed unused properties and methods
- Ensured all methods have proper type hints

PHPStan now runs with [OK] No errors at max level.
Psalm is set to max level (8) and reports only unused code warnings, which are acceptable for a demo project.
